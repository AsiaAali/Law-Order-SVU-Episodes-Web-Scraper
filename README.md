This program gets the Law & Order SVU episodes from the show's Wikipedia page and puts in it a txt file without quotations or capitalization.
This was built for the Cyberskyline Gymnasium passwork cracking challenge. Instead of copy and pasting 500+ edisode names, this does all the work for you.
Simply download the .py file and run it to get this list. 
The url can also be changed to collect episode names from other Wiki pages if needed.
